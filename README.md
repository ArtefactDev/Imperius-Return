Artefact - Imperius' Return
===========================

### Brief Summary
`Artefact is an RPG created in vanilla Minecraft, for singleplayer. It takes place in a fantasy world, which features both a sandbox experience and an adventure mode story experience. This is done by having the outside world include various enemies and ways to interact with the environment, but towns, cities, and dungeons put the player in adventure mode and include pretty much exclusively predetermined story encounters and interactions. The game is built on two main pillars: story and combat.` *-razorsharp*

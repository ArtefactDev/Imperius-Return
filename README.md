Artefact
===========================

### Brief Summary
`‘Artefact - Imperius’ Return’ is an RPG created in vanilla Minecraft, for singleplayer. It takes place in a vibrant fantasy world focused on story and combat. The gameplay is not realistic or gritty, it’s fun for the sake of fun. The combat will make you feel like a badass and the story is full of un-seriousness not typically found in large-scale fantasy.` *-razorsharp*
